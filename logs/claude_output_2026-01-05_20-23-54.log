The Rozetka AI Sales & Handoff System implementation requires several components. I've analyzed the project requirements and the existing codebase. Here's what I need to implement:

## Summary of Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment & Tooling
- Add `firebase-admin` and `httpx` dependencies to `pyproject.toml`
- Update `.env.example` with Firebase and Telegram webhook configuration

### Phase 2: Agent Logic (src/agent.py)
The main agent will include:
- `SalesAssistant` class extending `Agent` with sales-focused instructions
- `@function_tool` decorated methods for:
  - `send_link(platform, link)` - Sends links via Telegram webhook
  - `transfer_to_human(reason)` - Triggers handoff to human operator
- Integration with Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio model
- Firebase call logging and status updates

### Phase 3: Services & Tools
- `src/services/firebase_service.py` - Firestore integration for call logs, transcripts, prompts
- `src/services/meta_prompting.py` - "Mistake Box" prompt rewriting with Gemini 2.0 Flash
- `src/tools/telegram.py` - Telegram MTProto webhook caller

### Phase 4: Tests
- Unit tests for `send_link` and `transfer_to_human` tools
- Evaluation tests for agent behavior

Do you want me to proceed with the implementation? I'll need permission to:
1. Edit `pyproject.toml` to add dependencies
2. Edit `src/agent.py` to implement the sales agent
3. Create new service files in `src/services/`
4. Create new tool files in `src/tools/`
5. Update tests in `tests/`
6. Update `.env.example` with new environment variables

Please approve the file editing permissions and I'll implement the complete solution.
