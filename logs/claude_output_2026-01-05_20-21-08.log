I need permission to make edits. Let me ask you to grant the necessary permissions to proceed:

The project requires adding dependencies and creating/modifying files. Once you grant me edit permissions, I'll proceed with:

1. Adding `firebase-admin` and `httpx` to pyproject.toml
2. Creating the directory structure (`src/tools/`, `src/services/`, `config/`)
3. Implementing the Firebase service
4. Implementing function tools (`send_link`, `transfer_to_human`)
5. Updating the agent with Rozetka-specific instructions
6. Creating tests

Could you please grant me permission to edit files and run commands? I'll need to:
- Edit `pyproject.toml` to add dependencies
- Create new directories and files
- Run `uv sync` to install dependencies
- Run `uv run ruff check` and `uv run pytest` for verification
